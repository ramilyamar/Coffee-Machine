The program should repeatedly ask what the user wants to do.

User can input these actions: buy, fill, take, remaining, exit.

Buy.
If the user writes "buy" then he must choose one of three varieties of coffee that the coffee machine can make:
espresso, latte, or cappuccino.

For the espresso, the coffee machine needs 250 ml of water and 16 g of coffee beans. It costs $4.
For the latte, the coffee machine needs 350 ml of water, 75 ml of milk, and 20 g of coffee beans. It costs $7.
And for the cappuccino, the coffee machine needs 200 ml of water, 100 ml of milk, and 12 g of coffee. It costs $6.

If the coffee machine doesnâ€™t have enough resources to make coffee, the program should output a message
that says it can't make a cup of coffee.

If the user types "buy" to buy a cup of coffee and then changes his mind,
he should be able to type "back" to return into the main cycle.

For the espresso, the coffee machine needs 250 ml of water and 16 g of coffee beans. It costs $4.
